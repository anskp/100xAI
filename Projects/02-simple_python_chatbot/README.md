## 🚀 Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anskp/100xAI.git
cd 100xAI/Projects/02-simple_python_chatbot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install flask
```

3. Run the application:

python app.py
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000

## 💻 Usage

1. Type your message in the input field
2. Press Enter or click Send
3. The chatbot will respond based on the patterns it recognizes
4. Continue the conversation as long as you'd like

## 🧠 How It Works

The chatbot uses pattern matching to identify certain keywords or phrases in the user's input and responds accordingly. If no specific pattern is matched, it falls back to a default response.

The patterns are defined in the `chatbot.py` file and can be easily extended to add more functionality.
